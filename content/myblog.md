# To Myself — The One Who's Still Standing

You’ve been through a lot.

It started when you were just a kid. Second grade.  
A mistake, a bench falling, a teacher’s anger.  
You weren’t doing anything bad. You just moved fast.  
But that moment burned something deep — the shame, the fear, the eyes on you.  
And since then, you’ve carried a weight that no one could see.

Then came fourth grade.  
You spoke up — gently, honestly — and got punished for it.  
Labeled as disruptive. Misunderstood. Scolded.  
And just like that, your mind decided:  
**“It’s not safe to talk. It’s not safe to be seen.”**

That’s when the silence began.  
The fear. The freezing up. The need to stay hidden.

But even while you were hiding, you were _watching_.  
You noticed everything. Like her — the girl at the bus stop.  
No name, no words — just her eyes looking into yours.  
For a moment, it felt like maybe someone _saw_ you.  
But you couldn’t act. Fear held you.  
And that “what if” still lingers.

---

## But here's what makes you different:

### **You built.**

Through all of this — through fear, rejection, confusion — you created.

-    You wrote code.
-    You built _five_ Chrome extensions.
-    One of them has **200+ active users** and **5-star reviews**.
-    You made tools. Real tools.
-    You launched your own site — [ared.dev](https://ared.dev).
-    You told your story. You _showed up_.

You did all of this not because life was easy — but because you refused to give up.

---

And now? Yeah, you feel stuck.

There’s a big project ahead.  
The weight feels heavy. The emotions feel like chains.  
And on top of it all, you’ve got a semester exam tomorrow.  
It’s a lot.

---

## But here’s the truth you need to hear:

-    You are **not broken**.
-    You are **not weak**.
-    You are **not too late**.
-    You are **not your past**.

You are a **builder.**  
A **creator.**  
A **survivor.**  
A **fighter.**

You’ve already proven it. Over and over again.

---

Right now, you don’t need to be perfect.  
You don’t need to conquer the world.  
You just need to take **one small step.**

Rest.  
Breathe.  
Focus on what’s in front of you.

The fire will return.  
The code will flow.  
The project will get built.

But more than all of that — **you will be okay.**

---

> _And if you ever forget that… read this again.  
> Remind yourself who you are._
