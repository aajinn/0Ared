# how to build projects with ai (simple way)

so you wanna build a project using ai.
cool. here’s a super simple way to get it done without overthinking.

### step 1 – ask chatgpt for a full plan

open a new chat.
type something like:
**"hey, gimme a full detailed report on how to build [your idea]"**
you’ll get a full breakdown – features, stack, pages, everything.
copy or save it somewhere.

### step 2 – start a new chat

now ask it to generate prompts for cursor.
like:
**"based on that project plan, give me prompts to build it step-by-step in cursor."**
it’ll give you a list of prompts in order.
copy them.

### step 3 – paste prompts in cursor

open cursor
paste the prompts one by one
let it generate the code
tweak if needed

### step 4 – continue building

if you need new features
or get stuck
just ask chatgpt or cursor again
keep going till it’s done

---

### why not just ask cursor from the start?

because you need a clear goal first.
if you start without a plan, it gets messy fast.
you’ll end up building random stuff.

but if you plan it with chatgpt first,
then feed that into cursor,
everything makes sense and flows better.

that’s it.
ai helps you build fast and smooth.
no stress. just build.
